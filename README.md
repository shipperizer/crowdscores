# Programming Challenge

Hello, intrepid hacker! We have prepared a set of challenges for you to complete in your own time.

To get started, fork this repo and clone your fork. Start hacking away at the problems and please commit and push often so that we can follow your progress.

The first problem comes with test cases, which you can use and extend. For the following problems you are expected to write your own tests.

You should be able to finish the problems below in less than two hours.


## Problem 1: Counting Words

The classic problem: how often did she say 'I love you'?

Given a stream of text on stdin, report on stdout the number of times each word appears, sorted by mentions with the most often mentioned word first.

You will find a test case in `001-counting-words/test_count_words.py`. `cd` into the directory and run it with `py.test`.
