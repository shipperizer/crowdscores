# Programming Challenge

Hello, intrepid hacker! We have prepared a set of challenges for you to complete in your own time.

To get started, fork this repo and clone your fork. Start hacking away at the problems and please commit and push often so that we can follow your progress.

The first problem comes with test cases, which you can use and extend. For the following problems you are expected to write your own tests.

You should be able to finish the problems below in less than two hours.


## Problem 1: Counting Words

The classic problem: how often did she say 'I love you'?

Given a stream of text on stdin, report on stdout the number of times each word appears, sorted by mentions with the most often mentioned word first. To break a tie, order the words in lexicographical order.

You will find a test case in `001-counting-words/test_count_words.py`. `cd` into the directory and run it with `py.test`.


## Problem 2:


## Problem 3: Chaining Names

Your friends love music, and they like to play games. One game they like to play is to select the next song to play based on the current song. The next song has to begin with the same letter as the current song ends in.

For example, this playlist is valid:

+ 'Rock Me, Amadeus'
+ 'Song of the South'
+ 'Hooked on a Feeling'
+ 'Go Tell It on the Mountain'

So, given any starting and ending song, create a playlist that connects the two. For example: 'Island in the Sun' to 'Around the World'.

For extra credit, create the shortest playlist that connects the two.

For more extra credit, create a playlist of a specific duration (say, 45 minutes). This would be useful to fill a specific timeslot on the radio, for example.

For super much extra credit, come up with a challenging problem and a thrilling solution for a really dazzling display of your talent.


Your data set lives in song-library.json and should be self-describing.

Please include an analysis of the data structures and algorithms you chose, with a brief discussion of any alternative solutions you discarded and/or problems you faced and solved.
